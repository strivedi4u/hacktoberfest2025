   # Hacktoberfest 2025 — Community Algorithms & Projects

   This repository is a curated collection of small projects, algorithms, and beginner-friendly problems intended for contributors taking part in Hacktoberfest and for learners building their portfolios.

   If you're here to learn, contribute, or add your own project — welcome! This repo contains code in C/C++, Python, Java, JavaScript and small web demos. See the CONTRIBUTING guide for how to add projects and open pull requests.

   ## Quick links
   - License: Apache 2.0 — see `LICENSE`
   - Contributing: `CONTRIBUTING.md`
   - Code of Conduct: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

   ## What you'll find here

   - Small algorithm implementations (sorting, graph algorithms, dynamic programming).
   - Single-file practice problems (e.g. searching, math, string problems).
   - A few web pages and small JS/Python utilities.

   > Note: the repository is a community collection. File styles and languages vary by author.

   ## Repository layout (high level)

   Files and folders you will likely see at the root:

   - `*.cpp`, `*.py`, `*.java`, `*.c` — example solutions and small programs
   - `index.html`, `*.html`, `app.js`, `App.css` — small web demos
   - `README.md` — this file
   - `LICENSE` — repository license (Apache 2.0)
   - `.github/` — issue and PR templates

   There are many subfolders containing single-project demos. Use your editor to explore folders that match topics you care about (for example, `Backtraking/`, `Build Single Page Application/`, etc.).

   ## Getting started (for contributors)

   1. Fork the repository and clone your fork locally.
   2. Create a feature branch for your work (git checkout -b my-feature).
   3. Add or improve a program. Keep changes small and focused.
   4. Run or compile locally (see "Run & build" below).
   5. Push your branch and open a Pull Request. Use the PR template and link any related issue.

   See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for full details, coding style recommendations, and how to write commit messages.

   ## Run & build (common cases)

   These examples assume you're on Windows (PowerShell) or a Unix-like shell. Adjust commands to your environment.

   - C/C++ (g++):

     - Compile a single file:

       g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall path/to/file.cpp -o program.exe

     - Run the program:

       ./program.exe   # or .\program.exe on PowerShell

   - Python (3.x):

     python path\to\script.py

   - Java:

     javac MyProgram.java
     java MyProgram

   If you need help compiling a specific file in this repo, open an issue with the filename and your OS.

   ## How to contribute (short)

   - Pick an existing issue labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`, or open a small improvement/bugfix.
   - Add tests or a README for larger tasks when possible.
   - Keep PRs small and focused; describe what you changed and why in the PR body.

   Full contribution instructions are in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

   ## Labels and issues

   - good first issue — friendly for first-time contributors
   - help wanted — issues where maintainers welcome help
   - bug — reproducible problem with code or examples

   Maintainers will triage incoming issues and label them. If you want to help labeling, open a PR adding label suggestions in `.github/`.

   ## Code style and tests

   This repository doesn't enforce a single coding style. When contributing, follow these simple rules:

   - Keep files small and focused (one problem per file).
   - Add a short comment at the top of new files describing the problem, language, and how to run it.
   - Prefer descriptive names and avoid committing compiled binaries (except small demo outputs).

   If you add tests, include instructions so maintainers and other contributors can run them easily.

   ## Attribution & license

   This project is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be made available under the same license (see `LICENSE`).

   ## Need help?

   - Open an issue describing what you tried and what you need.
   - For quick questions, include the file path, the language, and the exact error or expected behaviour.

   Thank you for visiting and considering a contribution — small fixes and documentation updates are especially helpful!
