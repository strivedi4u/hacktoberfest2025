[![GitHub contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME)](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME/graphs/contributors)

This repository serves as a versatile, open-source collection of fundamental **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, implemented across multiple popular programming languages, including **C**, **C++**, and **Java**.

We welcome contributions of all skill levels! Join us in adding high-quality code and earning your Hacktoberfest 2025 badge! üéâ

**‚û°Ô∏è Please read the [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) file for full guidelines, setup instructions, and the Contributors List.**



## üí° Repository Scope and Structure

This repository is built around the principle of **language segregation**. All code is organized into top-level directories based on the language of implementation.

Within each language folder, you'll find solutions grouped by topic (e.g., Sorting, Dynamic Programming, Graphs).

| Core Topics | Sample Algorithms |
| **Arrays & Searching** | Kadane's Algorithm, Two Sum, Binary Search, Trapping Rain Water |
| **Sorting** | Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort |
| **Dynamic Programming** | Longest Common Subsequence (LCS), 0/1 Knapsack, Coin Change |
| **Advanced Techniques** | Backtracking (N-Queens, Sudoku), Graph Traversal (BFS, DFS) |
| **Data Structures** | Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Heaps, Trees |


## ‚ú® Hacktoberfest 2025 Contribution Guide

We encourage everyone‚Äîfrom first-time contributors to seasoned developers‚Äîto submit their best work. Your pull requests (PRs) help the community and count toward your official Hacktoberfest badge!

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Contribute

1.  **Star** this repository! ‚≠ê
2.  **Fork** the repository to your GitHub account.
3.  **Clone** your fork to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git)
    ```
4.  **Create a descriptive branch** for your solution:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/add-three-sum-cpp
    ```
5.  **Add your solution** to the **appropriate language directory**.
6.  **Commit** your changes with a clear, concise, and descriptive message. (e.g., `feat: Add O(n) Kadane's Algorithm in C++`)
7.  **Push** your branch and **open a Pull Request** to the `main` branch of this repository.

### ‚úÖ Code Standards

To ensure consistency and quality, please adhere to these guidelines:

| Standard | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Language Folder** | Place code in the correct top-level directory (e.g., `cpp/`, `java/`). |
| **Efficiency** | Solutions must be implemented using the **optimal time complexity** (e.g., use hashing for $O(n)$ Two Sum, not $O(n^2)$). |
| **Clarity & Comments** | Code must be clean and well-commented, including the algorithm's **time and space complexity** at the top of the file. |
| **Naming** | Use `snake_case` for filenames (e.g., `dijkstra_shortest_path.cpp`). |
| **Runnability** | All submissions must be self-contained and runnable, including necessary headers and a test case (driver code). |

Thank you for contributing! Happy coding! ü§ñ
