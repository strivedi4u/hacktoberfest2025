# Contributing to Hacktoberfest2025

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document explains how to contribute, code style suggestions, and how to open a high-quality pull request.

TL;DR:

- Fork the repo, create a branch, make changes, push, and open a PR.
- Keep changes small and focused.
- Add a short header comment to new files showing the problem and how to run the code.

1) Find something to work on

- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`.
- If you see a small bug, typo or missing README, that's a great first PR.
- You can also add a small algorithm implementation or a short project.

2) Branching and commits

- Create a feature branch from `main`:

  git checkout -b my-feature

- Use descriptive commit messages. One change per commit helps reviewers.

3) Code guidelines

- Keep files single-purpose and small.
- Add a top-of-file comment including:
  - Problem name or description
  - Language
  - How to compile/run the file

- For compiled languages, do not commit large binaries or build artifacts.

4) Tests and examples

- Small unit tests or example inputs/outputs are appreciated for non-trivial contributions.

5) Opening a PR

- Push your branch to your fork and open a Pull Request against `main` in this repository.
- Use a descriptive title and include:
  - What you changed and why
  - How to run or test your change
  - Any relevant screenshots or sample input/output

6) Licensing

All contributions are made under the repository license (Apache 2.0). By opening a PR, you confirm you have the right to contribute the code.

7) Need help?

- Open an issue asking for guidance and reference the file or topic you want to work on.

Thanks again â€” we appreciate your time and contributions!
